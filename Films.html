    <div><p> Let's talk about the films. Those wonderful films from Marvel and Disney.
        It all began with 'Iron Man' with the brilliant (and should have won an Oscar for 'Chaplin'), 
        Robert Downey Jnr. Even though, before it's release, every comic book fan in the world balked at
        the idea of him being cast in the role of the eponymous metal clad superhero, me included. Then we watched
        the film and that was it. There could be no other than Downey Jr.
        We won't talk about Iron Man 2 (It never happened).
        From then on it was a cascade of Superhero movies; Thor, Avengers, Captain America, Guardians of the Galaxy,
        Dr Strange, Ant Man and last but not least; Spiderman. All perfectly cast and yes I mean Hawkey too.
        Never before has the technology been advanced enough to render these super beings onto the silver screen.
        It makes me wonder what's to come in the future. With technology advancing almost daily, I can only
        imagine what that would mean for future films. What an experience that will be.
