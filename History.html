    <div><p>Excelsior! A little History.<br>
        Marvel Comics was established in 1939 by Martin Goodman, a magazine publisher at that time.<br>
        comic books, especially with superheroes, were in high demand.<br>
         This inspired Martin Goodman to create Timely Comics and so the birth of the Marvel Universe began.
          <br> 
         The first comic book was Marvel Comics no.1 and saw the Human Torch (not Johnny Storm of the later Fantasic Four fame but an android) and the Sub-Mariner first appear. 
         <br> During the “Golden Age” of the 1940's, many superhero characterss were created such as; Captain America. 
         <br>World War II saw Captain America and other comic book heroes, fight against Nazis and the 'Axis of evil'.
         <br>Unfortunately, by the end of the 1940's superhero comics were no longer popular, so Timely ended the superhero run in 1950.<br>
          Martin Goodman changed Timely Comics to Atlas Magazines in 1951 after starting his own distribution company along with his publishing company. <br>
         DC Comics commercial success in 1956 spurred Martin Goodman to try again with his own superhero comics again. <br>
        In the early 1960s Atlas changed its name to Marvel Comics.
        <br> For several decades Marvel and DC were the top companies in the industry. 
        <br>
        Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were taken into the Marvel fold in 1961.<br>
         This was the start of
        the comic books and superheroes we know and love today. Superheroes such as; The X-Men, Fantasic Four, Spiderman and of course The Hulk!
        And many more...
