    <div><p> This website maybe all about my life-long love of Marvel, but I have
        many passions. For instance; learning, I love to learn new things. Which is why, when 
        the opportunity came up to try coding with code nation appealed to me.<br>
        I enjoy being creative and do this by writing, drawing and painting (not walls, although that happens too).<br>
        Along with comics, reading books is also a huge part of my life.<br> I've read many wonderful books, such as'The Count of Monte Cristo'
         to the 'Disc world novels'.
